    <h2>Chicken Noodles Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      A bowl full of warm and freshly made noodles can turn your whole day
      upside down if you had been having a bad one! While we do not leave any
      chance of getting yourself a large serving of noodles every time we visit
      a Chinese restaurant, it happens most of the time that we crave for it the
      most when we know we canâ€™t get it. So, to get over times like those and to
      polish your cooking skills, here is an easy and oh-so-delicious recipe for
      homemade Chicken Hakka Noodles. Try these at home and you will not regret
      even a little bit. Do not wait any longer and get your hands on the right
      ingredients
    </p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>250 gm egg noodles</li>
      <li>1/2 cup onion</li>
      <li>2 tablespoon carrot</li>
      <li>4 tablespoon cabbage</li>
      <li>2 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon red chilli sauce</li>
      <li>black pepper as required</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon garlic</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon spring onion whites</li>
      <li>2 tablespoon capsicum (green pepper)</li>
      <li>100 gm shredded chicken</li>
      <li>2 teaspoon green chilli sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vinegar</li>
      <li>salt as required</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps Involved.</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Boil the chicken and the noodles</li>
      <p>
        You can also choose to marinate the chicken chunks in salt and pepper,
        cook them in some hot oil and keep them aside. Another method is boiling
        the chicken for about 15 minutes on medium to low flame and then
        shredding it into thin slices using two forks.
      </p>
      <li>Boil the noodles</li>
      <p>
        Boil some water in a pot and add salt to taste in it. Now add the
        noodles and let them cook for just about 2 minutes or 80% before they
        are done.
      </p>
      <li>Heat oil in a wok and cook veggies</li>
      <p>
        Add some oil in a wok and garlic to the pan. Now, add onions, green
        chillies, white portions of spring onions and roast them in the pan for
        about a minute. Now add all the remaining veggies like carrots, cabbage
        and capsicum and stir nicely.
      </p>
      <li>Add the sauces, noodles, stir and serve!</li>
      <p>
        Add the sauces and boiled chicken to the wok and mix everything
        together. Now add in your boiled Hakka egg noodles and season with some
        salt and pepper. Toss nicely without breaking any noodles. Garnish with
        spring onion greens and serve!
