    <h2>Chicken Biryani Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      Chicken biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's typically
      reserved for special occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such
      as Ramadan. It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth
      it. For biryani, basmati rice is the ideal variety to use.

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
      <li>4 small potatoes, peeled and halved</li>
      <li>2 large onions, finely chopped</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
      <li>2 medium tomatoes, peeled and chopped</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon chili powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
      <li>1 (2 inch) piece cinnamon stick</li>
      <li>3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken pieces cut into chunks</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare saffron-kewra water and chop veggies</li>
      <p>
        To make a delightful chicken biryani dish, firstly soak saffron in water
        to prepare saffron water (one tsp saffron can be soaked in 1/4 cup
        water). Next, mix kewra drops in water and mix well to make kewra water.
        Set them aside for later usage. Now, chop the onion and coriander leaves
        and keep them aside.
      </p>
      <li>Saute the onions</li>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a deep bottomed pan. Once the oil is hot
        enough, add cumin seeds, bay leaf, green cardamom, black cardamom,
        cloves in it, and saute for about a minute. Then, add chopped onion to
        it and saute until pink. Now, add chicken into it with slit green
        chillies, turmeric, salt to taste, ginger-garlic paste, red chilli
        powder and green chilli paste. Mix well all the spices and cook for 2-3
        minutes. Then, add hung curd into it and give a mix. (Make sure the
        chicken is washed properly and patted dry before adding it to the dish)
      </p>
      <li>Cook biryani on low heat for 5-6 minutes</li>
      <p>
        Turn the flame to medium again and add garam masala in it along with
        ginger julienned, coriander and mint leaves. Add kewra water, rose water
        and 1 tsp saffron water in it. Cook till the chicken is tender. Then add
        1 cup cooked rice and spread evenly. Then add the remaining saffron
        water and pour ghee over it. You can now cook the dish without the lid
        or cover it with a lid to give a dum-effect due to the steam formation.
      </p>
      <li>4 Serve hot chicken biryani with your favourite chutney or raita</li>
      <p>
        Cook for 15-20 minutes with a closed lid and garnish with 1 tbsp fried
        onions and coriander leaves. Serve hot chicken biryani with raita of
        your choice. Enjoy!
